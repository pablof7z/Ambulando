## Overview

Ambulando reimagines social media through the power of voice. Built on the [Nostr protocol](https://nostr.com), it creates an intimate, authentic space where people share wisdom, thoughts, and conversations through 60-second voice messages. The name "Ambulando" (Latin for "by walking") reflects our philosophy: thoughtful conversations that flow naturally, like talking while walking together.

## Philosophy

In a world of endless text posts and visual noise, Ambulando brings back the human element of communication. Voice carries emotion, nuance, and personality that text cannot convey. By limiting messages to 60 seconds, we encourage thoughtful, concise expression rather than endless scrolling.

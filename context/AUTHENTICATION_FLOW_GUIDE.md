## Technical Documentation: AuthenticationView Module

### 1. Module Overview

This document provides a technical deep-dive into the `AuthenticationView` module, which is responsible for user authentication within the Ambulando application.

#### 1.1. Purpose and Responsibilities

The primary purpose of `AuthenticationView` is to serve as the application's main entry point for unauthenticated users. It provides a seamless and secure interface for logging in using various Nostr-based authentication methods.

**Key Responsibilities:**

*   **UI Presentation:** Displays a visually engaging, animated welcome screen to new users and a clear, functional login form.
*   **Credential Handling:** Accepts user input for `nsec` private keys and NIP-46 connection strings (`bunker://`, `nostrconnect://`, NIP-05 identifiers).
*   **QR Code Scanning:** Integrates with a QR scanner to allow users to input credentials without typing.
*   **Authentication Logic:** Orchestrates the login process by interfacing with the `NostrManager` and the underlying `NDKSwift` framework.
*   **State Management:** Manages all internal UI states, including loading indicators, animations, and error message displays.
*   **System State Transition:** Signals successful authentication to the rest of the application via the shared `AppState`.

#### 1.2. Key Interfaces and Entry Points

The module is a SwiftUI `View` that interacts with the system primarily through environment objects.

*   **View:** `AuthenticationView()`
*   **Dependencies (Injected via `@EnvironmentObject`):**
    *   `NostrManager`: The central service layer for all Nostr-related operations. The view calls `nostrManager.login()` to initiate authentication.
    *   `AppState`: A shared, app-wide state object. The view updates `appState.isAuthenticated` upon successful login.
*   **Primary Logic Entry Point:**
    *   `private func login()`: This internal function is triggered by the user and contains all the core logic for handling different authentication flows.

#### 1.3. Dependencies and Relationships

*   **SwiftUI:** For building the user interface and managing view state.
*   **NDKSwift:** The core Nostr framework providing all necessary types and functions for authentication, such as `NDKPrivateKeySigner` and `NDKBunkerSigner`.
*   **NostrManager & AppState:** These act as the bridge between `AuthenticationView` and the rest of the app's architecture, facilitating dependency injection and state propagation.
*   **QRScannerView:** A reusable component for scanning QR codes.

### 2. Technical Architecture

#### 2.1. Internal Structure and Organization

The `AuthenticationView` is composed of a `ZStack` that conditionally displays one of two major UI states, managed by the `@State var showingLogin: Bool`:

1.  **Welcome Screen (`!showingLogin`):** An animated introduction featuring the app's logo and branding. It is designed to be visually appealing and encourages the user to proceed.
2.  **Login Form (`showingLogin`):** A functional screen containing the input fields and buttons required for authentication.

State is managed internally using `@State` properties for UI-specific data (`authInput`, `isLoggingIn`) and animation control (`logoScale`, `titleOffset`).

#### 2.2. Key Functions and Their Roles

*   `body: some View`: The main computed property that builds the SwiftUI view. It contains the top-level logic for switching between the welcome screen and the login form.
*   `loginForm: some View`: A private computed property that encapsulates the entire UI for the login form, promoting code organization.
*   `animateIntro()`: An internal function that orchestrates the complex sequence of animations for the welcome screen, creating a polished user experience.
*   `login()`: The most critical function in the module. It contains the business logic to parse the user's input, determine the correct authentication method, create the appropriate `NDKSigner`, and initiate the login process.

#### 2.3. Data Flow

The authentication data flow is unidirectional and driven by user actions and state changes:

1.  **User Input:** The user types their credential into the `SecureField` or uses the QR scanner. The input is stored in the `@State var authInput: String`.
2.  **Action Trigger:** The user taps the "Log In" button, which invokes the `login()` function.
3.  **Initiate Login:** The `login()` function sets `@State var isLoggingIn = true`, which updates the UI to show a loading state.
4.  **Credential Analysis:** Inside `login()`, the `authInput` string is analyzed to determine the authentication method.
5.  **Signer Creation & Login:** The appropriate `NDKSigner` is created and passed to `nostrManager.login(with: signer)`.
6.  **Asynchronous Handling:** The entire login process is handled within a Swift Concurrency `Task`.
    *   **Success:** `nostrManager` signals success, and `AuthenticationView` updates the shared `AppState.isAuthenticated` to `true`.
    *   **Failure:** The `catch` block captures any errors, updates `@State var errorMessage`, and presents an alert to the user.
7.  **State Propagation:** The parent view (`ContentView`) observes the change in `AppState` and replaces `AuthenticationView` with the main application view (`HomeFeedView`).



### 3. Implementation Details

#### 3.1. Core Logic: The `login()` Function

The `login()` function is the heart of the module. It handles two distinct and complex authentication flows.

**1. nsec (Private Key) Authentication:**

This is the simpler flow for users who provide their `nsec` key directly.

```swift
if authInput.starts(with: "nsec") {
    // 1. Create a signer from the private key.
    let signer = try NDKPrivateKeySigner(nsec: authInput)
    // 2. Initiate the login session with the manager.
    let sessionData = try await nostrManager.login(with: signer)
    
    // 3. Update global app state on success.
    await MainActor.run {
        appState.isAuthenticated = true
        appState.currentUser = nostrManager.ndk?.getUser(sessionData.pubkey)
    }
}
```

**2. NIP-46 (Remote Signer / Bunker) Authentication:**

This flow is significantly more complex as it involves communicating with a remote signing device (like a hardware wallet or another app) via a "bunker". It supports multiple URI schemes.

```swift
} else { // Handles bunker://, nostrconnect://, or NIP-05
    // 1. Determine the correct bunker type from the input string.
    let bunkerSigner: NDKBunkerSigner
    if authInput.starts(with: "bunker://") {
        // ... create bunker signer
    } else if authInput.starts(with: "nostrconnect://") {
        // ... create nostrconnect signer
    } else if authInput.contains("@") {
        // ... create NIP-05 signer
    }

    // 2. CRITICAL: Set the signer on the NDK instance *before* connecting.
    // This allows NDK to use the signer for any handshake-related events.
    ndk.signer = bunkerSigner

    // 3. Listen for an authorization URL in a separate, concurrent Task.
    // This handles cases where the user needs to approve the login from their signing app.
    let authUrlTask = Task {
        for await authUrl in await bunkerSigner.authUrlPublisher.values {
            await MainActor.run {
                errorMessage = "Authorization required! Open this URL...\n\n\(authUrl)"
                showError = true
            }
        }
    }

    // 4. Await the connection to the remote signer.
    let user = try await bunkerSigner.connect()
    authUrlTask.cancel() // 5. Cancel the listener once connected.

    // 6. Start the session now that the remote signer is connected.
    let sessionData = try await nostrManager.login(with: bunkerSigner)

    // 7. Update global app state.
    await MainActor.run {
        appState.isAuthenticated = true
        appState.currentUser = nostrManager.ndk?.getUser(sessionData.pubkey)
    }
}
```

#### 3.2. Important Patterns and Design Decisions

*   **State-Driven UI:** The view relies heavily on `@State` properties to manage its appearance. This is a standard and effective pattern in SwiftUI for creating reactive and predictable UIs.
*   **Asymmetric Transitions:** The use of `.transition(.asymmetric(...))` provides a more polished and professional feel when navigating between the welcome and login screens, as the enter and exit animations are different.
*   **Concurrent URL Handling for NIP-46:** The decision to observe the `authUrlPublisher` in a separate `Task` is critical. It allows the app to concurrently wait for the `bunkerSigner.connect()` call to complete while also being ready to immediately show the user an external approval URL if one is emitted.
*   **Environment Objects for Decoupling:** Using `@EnvironmentObject` for `NostrManager` and `AppState` decouples `AuthenticationView` from its parent. It doesn't need to know how these objects were created, only that they exist in the environment.

### 4. Integration Points

#### 4.1. How Other Parts of the System Interact with This Module

*   **`ContentView`:** Acts as the parent and router. It displays `AuthenticationView` when no active session exists. It listens for changes to `appState.isAuthenticated` (or `NDKAuthManager.shared.hasActiveSession`) to dismiss `AuthenticationView` and present the `HomeFeedView`.
*   **`NostrManager`:** It is the direct service layer this module uses. `AuthenticationView` offloads all core Nostr logic to `NostrManager`, keeping the view focused on UI and user interaction.
*   **`NDKAuthManager`:** Although not directly referenced, `NostrManager` uses `NDKAuthManager` under the hood to securely persist `nsec` keys in the Keychain.

#### 4.2. External Dependencies

*   **`NDKSwift`:** This is the most critical external dependency. `AuthenticationView` directly uses several of its components:
    *   `NDKPrivateKeySigner`: For `nsec` login.
    *   `NDKBunkerSigner`: For NIP-46 login.
    *   `NDKError`: For error handling.

### 5. Usage Guide

#### 5.1. How to Properly Use This Module

`AuthenticationView` is designed to be a complete, self-contained screen. It should be presented when the application detects that the user is not authenticated.

The most common pattern is to use it as one of the branches in a conditional view statement at the root of the application, as demonstrated in `ContentView.swift`.

#### 5.2. Example Use Case

The existing `ContentView` provides the canonical example for using this module.

```swift
// In ContentView.swift

struct ContentView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var nostrManager: NostrManager
    @EnvironmentObject var appState: AppState

    var body: some View {
        // Use the auth manager to check for a persisted session.
        let authManager = NDKAuthManager.shared
        let isAuth = authManager.hasActiveSession

        ZStack {
            if isAuth {
                // If authenticated, show the main app.
                HomeFeedView()
            } else {
                // Otherwise, show the AuthenticationView.
                AuthenticationView()
            }
        }
        .onAppear {
            // Ensure the app state is synchronized on appear.
            checkAuthentication()
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```

#### 5.3. Common Patterns and Best Practices

*   **Provide Environment Objects:** Ensure that both `NostrManager` and `AppState` are injected into the SwiftUI environment before `AuthenticationView` (or its parent) is rendered.
*   **Rely on `AppState` for Navigation:** Do not attempt to add completion handlers or callbacks to `AuthenticationView`. Instead, observe the `appState.isAuthenticated` property from a parent view to handle the transition away from the login screen.
*   **Error Handling:** The view handles its own error display through alerts. No external error handling is required.
*   **Do Not Re-implement Logic:** The `login()` function is self-contained. Avoid triggering its logic from outside the view itself. The view's lifecycle and user interaction are designed to manage the process.
